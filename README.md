#Project Overview 

"SysQube Store" is a fictional online store, and this project aims to develop a responsive e-commerce checkout process. As part of my frontend developer internship, I implemented the following steps in the checkout process:

1. Cart Overview 
2. Shipping Information 
3. Payment Information 
4. Order Summary 

Each step is designed to be visually distinct, clearly indicating the user's progress, and ensuring a seamless user experience on both mobile and web versions.
